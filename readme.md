# Tier 1 Week 4 - Part 1

This week we'll be pulling together all of the Javascript techniques you've learned thus far as well as practicing with HTML & CSS.

## Topics Covered

- variables
- arrays
- conditionals
- functions
- HTML & CSS

## Assignment - Function Practice

**REMINDER:** Make sure to answer the Slack discussion question for this week!

Complete the `function-practice.js` file. 
> Note that the first problem is completed for you as an example.

In this file you will *__fill in__* the missing code to complete the function as described in the comments. (Think of it as similar to fill in the blanks, but we don't show you where the blanks are.) To do this, you may need to add input parameters, return values and/or logic to the function body. For the last few, you'll need to write it all!

After completing each function. Make sure to call (or use) the function in your code (as shown in the example) to test it and make sure it works correctly. For more complex functions, test multiple outcomes to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios. 

## Assignment Submission
